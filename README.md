## Developer Documentation

**https://developer.webex-cx.com/documentation/guides/desktop**  
**https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/v1/call-controls**

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository:
- ```git clone https://github.com/wxsd-sales/cc-meeting-transfer-widget.git```

The widget can be hosted locally for testing on the same machine as the agent desktop.  However, you will want to deploy this to a webserver with an SSL certificate when going live.

To understand how to interact with our Desktop Layout, please watch the video and supplemental detailed documentation @ **[Desktop Layout - Administration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/cust_contact/contact_center/webexcc/SetupandAdministrationGuide_2/b_mp-release-2/b_cc-release-2_chapter_011.html#topic_8230815F4023699032326F948C3F1495)**

## Installation

### 1. Setting up the Webex Integration

* a. [Create a new Webex Oauth "Integration"](https://developer.webex.com/my-apps/new)
  * i. The creator/owner of the integration does not matter, but must have a Webex account.
  * ii. You can give it any name ("Contact Center Meeting Transfer Widget") and any 512x512 icon - the Agents signing into it will only ever see the name and icon the first time signing in.
* b. The redirect URI of the integration must be ```YOURSERVERURL/auth```, examples:
  * i. ```http://localhost:5000/auth```
  * ii. ```https://your.server.com/auth```
* c. Whatever your server address, you will need this again in the next steps (just the base url, NOT including "/auth").
* d. The Scopes selected must be:
  * ```spark:calls_read```
  * ```spark:calls_write```
  * ```spark:people_read```
  * ```spark:xsi```
* e. Save the client_id, and client_secret for the next step

### 2. Setting up the .env file
- a. Inside this project's root folder, rename the file ```.env.example``` to ```.env```
- b. In a text editor, open the ```.env```
- c. Choose a ```PORT``` or use ```PORT=5000``` if you are not sure what to use.
- d. Paste the client_id and client_secret values from step 1 to the right of the ```=``` for the corresponding ```CLIENT_ID=``` and ```CLIENT_SECRET=``` variables.
- e. Paste your base url for your server between the double quotes of ```HOST_URI=""```.  If referring to examples from step 1, then either:
  - i. ```HOST_URI="http://localhost:5000"```
  - ii. ```HOST_URI="https://your.server.com"```

### 3.a. Running the widget webserver as a container (Docker) (recommended)

- If you prefer to run this through ```npm```, skip this step and proceed to 3.b.
- Otherwise, run the following commands from the terminal inside your project's root directory:
- `docker build -t cc-meeting-transfer-widget .`
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 -i -t cc-meeting-transfer-widget`
  - replace `5000` in both places with the ```PORT``` used in your `.env` file.  

### 3.b. Running the widget webserver (npm)
_Node.js version >= 14.5 must be installed on the system in order to run this through npm._

- It is recommended that you run this as a container (step 3.a.).
- If you do not wish to run the webserver as a container (Docker), proceed with this step:
- Inside this project on your terminal type: `npm install`
- Then inside this project on your terminal type: `npm run build`
- Then inside this project on your terminal type: `npm run dev`
- This should run the app on your ```PORT``` (from .env file)


### 4. Wire Up the Widget to the Layout:

- You must replace the url on line 108 of the **_callControlWidget.json_** file with your correct server endpoint. For examples:
  - "script": "http://localhost:5000/build/bundle.js",
  - "script": "https://your.webserver.com/build/bundle.js",
- This should be based on the ```HOST_URI``` in your .env file + ```/build/bundle.js```.
  
- Upload the **_callControlWidget.json_** file onto your Administration Portal **[WebexCC Portal - US](https://portal.wxcc-us1.cisco.com/portal/home.html#)**
  - _link above is referencing the US portal link please change if you are in different geo (us1, eu1, eu2, anz1)_
  - Note that Layouts are configured per Agent Team.
- Log in to your agent and select the right Team to view the new layout.

**Additional Improvements:**

- You can modify the widget as required.
- To create a new compiled JS file, using `npm run build` which will create the new compiled JS under `build/bundle.js`.
- You may rename this file, host it on your server of choice, and use this as the widget `src` parameter in the layout.
